The Personal Library Manager is a single-page CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built with React. It allows users to manage their personal collection of books. The application stores book data in the browser's localStorage to ensure data persistence between sessions.

=> Technologies Used

Bootstrap (optional): For responsive UI.

LocalStorage: To persist data without a backend.

useState: Manages book form (book), book list (books), and editing state (editId).

useEffect: On initial load, fetches books from localStorage.
